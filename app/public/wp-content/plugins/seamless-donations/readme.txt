== Description ==

= Five Minutes to Your First Donation =

Seamless Donations is so easy to install and configure that your Web site can accept donations via your Stripe or PayPal account within five minutes of downloading the plugin.

**Seamless Donations is free and does not charge you a commission or percentage fee.**

Other vendors take 2% right off the top of every Stripe transaction unless you purchase an expensive add-on. Seamless Donations does not siphon off money from donations intended for your good causes.

Learn more on the [Seamless Donations home page](http://zatzlabs.com/project/seamless-donations/).

= Automatic Recurring Donations For Stripe and PayPal =

You can instantly give your donors the option to make their donation repeat automatically. You can turn on on the option with a click, which gives your donors a checkbox to make any donation repeat. This feature is free for both Stripe and PayPal.

= Other Free Premium Features =

Seamless Donations comes with free features other plugin vendors charge hundreds of dollars for. In addition to free recurring donations and the Stripe gateway, Seamless Donations includes:

* **Tributes:** Designate a donation "in honor of" or "in memory of" and specify both the honoree and person to notify when the honor donation is made.
* **Gift Aid:** For those of you in the UK, once you specify UK as your country, Gift Aid is automatically enabled.

= Watch the Intro Tutorial =

Seamless Donations users can also purchase the [Beautiful Donation Forms](https://zatzlabs.com/project/seamless-donations-beautiful-donation-forms/) or the [Colorful Donation Forms](https://zatzlabs.com/project/seamless-donations-colorful-donation-forms/) style pack, containing hand-crafted, responsive forms designed to encourage donors to gift to your organization.

= Track Donors and Donations =

Seamless Donations uses standard WordPress post types for Donors, Donations, and Funds so not only can you keep track of your most important contributors, you can use all of WordPress’ tools and plugins to manage them.

= Show Donors Your Appreciation =

You can email donors customized email Thank You messages. You can also set up “in honor of” donations and send a customized Thank You email to a designated recipient. With the [Thank You Enhanced extension](http://zatzlabs.com/project/seamless-donations-thank-you-enhanced/) you can display custom Thank You pages personalized for each donor.

= Docs, FAQ, Video Tutorials, and Support =

= Here are some of the major features added since 4.0 =

* **Full Stripe support:** Seamless Donations now provides full, native Stripe support, including support for recurring donations
* **Gorgeous donation forms:** Redesigned, responsive default form, plus a library of 35 additional form designs available for purchase.
* **Updated, modern admin UI:** The admin interface has been updated to a modern tabbed-look.
* **Custom post types:** Funds and donors have now been implemented as custom post types. This gives you the ability to use all of WordPress’ post management and display tools with donors and funds. The donation data has always been a custom post type, but it is now also available to manipulate using
plugins and themes outside of Seamless Donations.
* **Designed for extensibility:** The primary design goal of 4.0 was to add hooks in the form of filters and actions that web designers can use to modify the behavior of Seamless Donations to fit individual needs. The plugin was re-architected to allow for loads of extensibility.
* **Forms engine designed for extensibility:** Rather than just basic form code, Seamless Donations 4.0 now has a brand-new array-driven forms engine, which will give web site builders the ability to modify and access every part of the form before it is displayed to donors.
* **Shortcode engine designed for extensibility:** The main shortcode for the plugin has been designed so that extensions can add features to the main seamless-donations shortcode.
* **Admin UI designed for extensibility:** Yep, like everything else, the admin interface has been designed to allow for extensibility.
* **Translation-ready:** Seamless Donations 4.0 has had numerous tweaks to allow it to be translated into other languages.

Special thanks to Allen Snook for originally creating the plugin and making adoption possible.

== Installation ==

**IMPORTANT: Support has moved to the ZATZLabs site and is no longer provided on the WordPress.org forums. Please visit the new [Seamless Donations Community Forums](http://zatzlabs.com/forums/). If you need a timely reply from the developer, please [open a ticket](http://zatzlabs.com/submit-ticket/).**

1. Upload/install the Seamless Donations plugin
2. Activate the plugin
3. Set the email address for PayPal donations in the plugin settings
4. Create a new blank page (e.g. Donate Online)
5. Add the following shortcode to the page : [seamless-donations]
6. That's it - you're now receiving donations!

For those updating from 3.3 to 4.0, go to your Plugins page and deactivate Seamless Donations. Then delete the plugin. Refresh your plugins page (this is very important, make sure to refresh). Now you can Add New and bring Seamless Donations 4.0 onto your site. **If you are experiencing problems upgrading from v3 to v4, [read this](http://zatzlabs.com/fixing-seamless-donations-4-0-updateactivation-problems/).**

If you are updating from 4.0.x to 5.0.x and are using add-ons, [this guide](https://zatzlabs.com/how-to-apply-the-beta-plugins-to-your-wordpress-install/) may help.

This video will provide more details:

= Be sure to test for the following changes moving from 3.0 to 4.0 or 5.0 =
* **Change the form shortcode:** The [dgx-donate] shortcode is deprecated and will issue an update warning once you update. The new shortcode is [seamless-donations].
* **Check your CSS:** Most of the CSS should remain the same, but because the form interaction has been updated, your CSS may change.
* **Check your data:** Great pains have been taken to be sure the data migrates correctly, but please, please, PLEASE double-check it.

= 5.0.2 =
* Added new action seamless_donations_tab_settings_before_payments which runs just before seamless_donations_tab_settings_before_paypal.

You can process admin form validations for any button pressed in the Seamless Donations admin UI. The filter is validate_page_slug_[page_slug_name]. For example, if a page’s slug is seamless_donations_tab_thanks, it calls the filter validate_page_slug_seamless_donations_tab_thanks.
* Changed the naming convention for all admin callbacks. Prior to 5.0, admin pages were previously of the form seamless_donations_admin_[name] and, as of 5.0, are now of the form seamless_donations_tab_[name]. Therefore any callback that would have used the slug seamless_donations_admin_[name] must now use the slug seamless_donations_tab_[name].
