Olivia is an intelligent, dedicated and extremely driven student. Her commitment to learning, her passion for ballet, and her dedication to leadership is unmatched among her peers. With her desire for excellence and her uncompromising commitment to personal growth, Olivia is a perfect fit for Lincoln GOLD. Additionally, as someone who is in the field of education, I know that the experience that Olivia will gain through this opportunity will broaden her horizons and help to shape her future while empowering her to make a real difference with her life.
