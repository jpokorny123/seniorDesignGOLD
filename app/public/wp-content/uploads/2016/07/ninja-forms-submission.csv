Makayla would fit well among this group, as she makes a positive impact to everything she comes into contact with. She is an AP student with a 4.1 GPA, 6-time honor roll recipient, and holds two academic letters. Makayla is very involved with Student Council, as well - not only Lincoln High's, but also the District's. There were a numerous amount of fundraisers and events she helped with. She received a letter in her first year, and is planning to run for an office this year! Student Council has really helped flourish her leadership capacity. Red Cross Club at her school is also a priority in Makayla's life. She attends every meeting, and helps organize/execute the blood donation drives that happen four times a year at her school. She plans to work even harder to make her school the high school with the highest number of units donated to the Blood Bank.
 Along with that, Makayla played volleyball for four years, and was captain of her freshman and sophomore teams. This shows her ability to be a leader, even when there's competition involved. Outside of school, Makayla seems to always be volunteering. Her volunteer experience and connections would make a good fit in this program- she has served for hundreds of hours during her high school years. Within the past year, she's spent nearly 100 hours volunteering- 70 of those hours being from non-profit organizations.
There's also things about Makayla that cannot be measured on paper, such as her inclusive personality, and willingness to help others. She is THE optimist, kind to everyone she meets, and has an unbelievably great work ethic.
Thank you for considering Makayla for this program.","Mrs. Nicole Barnes
