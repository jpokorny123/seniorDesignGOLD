She keeps a busy schedule, but she uses her time to help others as well. During the summer she runs a girl empowerment program at the Salvation Army to help younger girls learn skills to help combat bullying as well as gain self-confidence.  She is very dedicated to empowering others all around the world as well as the people around her.  She is a key part of Girl Up LPS and Girl Up Nebraska and she uses her platform to help others through encouraging events and actions.  I believe as a G.O.L.D. member, Abby will learn and gain important leadership roles to spread to younger girls and to help better those around her. ","Ellie Roselius (402)770-9441
