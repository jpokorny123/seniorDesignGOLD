She makes a positive impact in every group in which she belongs- and she is a central member of many groups at Waverly High School.

Brianna is unlike any student I have ever taught.  She is more responsible, level-headed, and organized than most adults I know.  Dependability and determination are her best assets.  When she says she will do something, you know that it will be completed with the highest quality.  Brianna is the co-editor-in-chief for yearbook, a position usually held by a senior.  And right now, we are in the point of the school year when I get stressed, wondering if the yearbook will ever get finished.  In years past, the week after graduation is spent trying to gather the editors to complete the process of editing, making group pages, and indexing. However, this year, the yearbook is almost completely finished.  Other than state track and graduation (events that do not happen until the very end of the year), everything is done.  It is unbelievable- but that is how Brianna operates.  You give her your highest expectations, and she will exceed them.

Brianna needs the opportunity to connect with other women who are as accomplished and driven as she is.  She needs to see that she has a place.  I know that Brianna cares deeply about giving back to her community, being successful, and creating the best life she can.  As a Lincoln G.O.L.D. member, Brianna will seek out any opportunity to grow and learn from other strong women. She is teachable and polite, yet independent and self-motivated.  I really cannot tell you enough how positively Brianna would impact your group.  But more importantly, she would be impacted by the women she meets from Lincoln G.O.L.D.
