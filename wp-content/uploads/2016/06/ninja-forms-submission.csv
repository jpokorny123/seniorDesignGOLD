She is currently the Miss High School Nebraska and since earning that title, she has met with state legislators, school administrators and students and implementing an anti-bullying program in schools called B.R.A.V.E. 

She has started her own blog, encouraging positive exchanges between young girls who have been bullied. She works very hard with me through her Springboard training and always does her homework. 

**I can get her school activities if needed. ","Karalyn Hoefer, 402.450.1355, karalyn.hoefer@gmail.com
