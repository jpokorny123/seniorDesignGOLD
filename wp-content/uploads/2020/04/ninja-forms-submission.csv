She hasnâ€™t always had the easiest life but has showed her love and kindness by putting everyone before her. Her love for people is truly inspiring. She makes people smile on there worst days! She is truly what I hope to be when I find my self as a following teenager. I really hope you guys can consider my best fire down because she could be an extreme aspect in your program!
