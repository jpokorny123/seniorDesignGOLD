She is an incredibly intelligent, articulate, goal driven young lady. She has high aspirations to attend an Ivy League school and is a very hard working, dedicated individual. She has had much academic success at East, has excelled in debate, and was a member of the cheer squad freshman and sophomore years. She would be an asset to this program.
